        //dom reprsents the page content as HTML.

        //means :- Object properties and Method
        //or we can also say that Parent Child and sibling Relationship.
        //which allow to modify style , content , or structure of html page , dynamically at(rum-time occurence of any event).

        //ex:- img displayed in bigger size on mouse hover event.
        //selecting some radio button which will display some div on the page .
        //modifying style :- on focusing event background color of form feild should be changed.
        //after click of button , button gets disabled .

        //DOM :- Always viewed as Node Tree. which is created for HTML document.
        


       // document.body//your whole page body
        
        //if u wanted u changed background color through js code .
        document.body.style.backgroundColor="Yellow";

        //js is all about mind of web page .
        //what logic u should use all things will be written in js already.
        
        //But above code is not valid , u want to change something when user perform some event or action than only js changed else not.
