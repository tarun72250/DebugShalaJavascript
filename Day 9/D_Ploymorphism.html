      /*    Polymorphism: 
        Polymorphism is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming languages. Polymorphism means the same function with different signatures is called many times. In 
 
        Real life ex :- for example, a boy at the same time may be a student, a class monitor, etc. So a boy can perform different operations at the same time. Polymorphism can be achieved by method overriding and method overloading
  
        one more ex :- At traffic signal when red light all vehicles are stop , but their stoping vehcile mechanism are different.

        one more ex :- At cricket match when refry says start , all players did different things , baller take run , feilder get attentioned on ball , or batsman take stance on pitch .



        Example: Let’s understand polymorphism with an example.

       // Polymorphism example
        class person 
        {
            constructor(name) 
            {
                this.name = name;
            }
            // method to return the string
            toString() 
            {
                return (`Name of person: ${this.name}`);
            }
        }

        class student extends person 
        {
            constructor(name, id) 
            {
                // super keyword for calling the above 
                // class constructor
                super(name);
                this.id = id;
            }
            toString() 
            {
                return (`${super.toString()},
                Student ID: ${this.id}`);
            }
        }
        
        class employee extends person 
        {
            constructor(name, id) 
            {
                // super keyword for calling the above 
                // class constructor
                super(name);
                this.empno = empno;
            }
            toString() 
            {
                return (`${super.toString()},
                Employee No: ${this.empno}`);
            }
        }

        let student1 = new student('tarun', 23);
        document.write(student1.toString());

        
        let employee1 = new employee('tarun', 23);
        document.write(employee1.toString());

        Output: In this example, we define a Person Object with certain properties and methods and then we inherit the Person Object in the Student Object  or Employee Object and use all the properties and methods of the person Object as well as define certain properties and methods for the Student Object and Employee Object.

        Output :
        Name of Person : tarun , Student ID : 23
        Name of Person : tarun , Employee No : 23
        
        Note: The Person and Student objects both have the same method (i.e toString()), this is called Method Overriding. Method Overriding allows a method in a child class to have the same name(polymorphism) and method signature as that of a parent class. 
        
        In the above code, the super keyword is used to refer to the immediate parent class’s instance variable. 
        and invoking super methods as well.
