        How is Object-Oriented Programming implemented in JavaScript? 
        How does it differ from other languages? 
        Can you implement Inheritance in JavaScript?
        and so on…

        There are certain features or mechanisms which make a Language Object-Oriented like:

        Object
        Classes	
        Abstraction
        Encapsulation
        Inheritance	
        Polymorphism


        Object :- Object is tangible(physical :- Student , Person , Employee) and non-tangible(account , software  ) entity.
                Object has some state.
                Object can execute certain behaviour.
                Object has some unique identity.
                Object has some role in a particular system.

        Note: A Method in javascript is a property of an object whose value is a function. 

        The object can be created in two ways in JavaScript:

        Object Literal
        Object Constructor

        Example:1. Using an Object Literal.

        // Defining object
        let person = {
            first_name: 'Tarun',
            last_name: 'Rathore',

            //method
            getFunction: function () {
                return (`The name of the person is 
                ${person.first_name} ${person.last_name}`)
            },
            //object within object
            phone_number: {
                mobile: '12345',
                landline: '6789'
            }
        }
        document.write(person.getFunction());
        document.write(person.phone_number.landline);

        Output: The name of the Person is tarun rathore
        6789


        Example:2. Using an Object Constructor.

        // Using a constructor
        function person(first_name, last_name) {
            this.first_name = first_name;
            this.last_name = last_name;
        }
        // Creating new instances of person object
        let person1 = new person('tarun', 'rathore'); // new is a keyword , which creates Object 
        let person2 = new person('Piyush', 'Bhagat');
        
        document.write(person1.first_name);
        document.write(`${person2.first_name} ${person2.last_name}`);

        Output: tarun
        Piyush Bhagat


        Note: The JavaScript Object.create() Method creates a new object, using an existing object as the prototype of the newly created object.

        Example:

        // Object.create() example a
        // simple object with some properties
        const coder = {
            isStudying: false,
            printIntroduction: function () {
                console.log(`My name is ${this.name}. Am I 
                    studying?: ${this.isStudying}.`)
            }
        }
        // Object.create() method
        const me = Object.create(coder);

        // "name" is a property set on "me", but not on "coder"
        me.name = 'tarun';

        // Inherited properties can be overwritten
        me.isStudying = true;

        me.printIntroduction();

        Output: My name is tarun . Am I Studying?: true
        -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


        Class :- Class is a template or blueprint where we can define state and behaviour of particular Object.
                or we can A class can have many Objects because the class is a template while Objects are instances of the class or the concrete implementation. 
                
           Note :-Before we move further into implementation, we should know unlike other Object Oriented languages there are no classes in JavaScript we have only Object. To be more precise, JavaScript is a prototype-based Object Oriented Language, which means it doesn’t have classes, rather it defines behaviors using a constructor function and then reuses it using the prototype. 

           Note: Even the classes provided by ECMA2015 are objects.

           The class syntax is not introducing a new object-oriented inheritance model to JavaScript. JavaScript classes provide a much simpler and clearer syntax to create objects and deal with inheritance. 

           Example: Let’s use ES6 classes then we will look at the traditional way of defining an Object and simulate them as classes.

           // Defining class using es6
            class Vehicle 
            {
                constructor(name, maker, engine) 
                {
                    this.name = name;
                    this.maker = maker;
                    this.engine = engine;
                }
                getDetails() 
                {
                    return (`The name of the bike is ${this.name}.`)
                }
            }

            // Making object with the help of the constructor
            let bike1 = new Vehicle('Hayabusa', 'Suzuki', '1340cc');
            let bike2 = new Vehicle('Ninja', 'Kawasaki', '998cc');

            console.log(bike1.name); // Hayabusa
            console.log(bike2.maker); // Kawasaki
            console.log(bike1.getDetails());

            Output: Hayabusa
                    Kawasaki
                    The name of the bike is Hayabusa.
                
            
            
            Example: Traditional Way of defining an Object and simulating them as classes.

            // Defining class in a Traditional Way.
            function Vehicle(name, maker, engine) 
            {
                this.name = name,
                    this.maker = maker,
                    this.engine = engine
            };
            

             //here in fn based Object we should not use any fn inside it.

            Vehicle.prototype.getDetails = function () 
            {
                document.write('The name of the bike is ' + this.name);
            }
            
            let bike1 = new Vehicle('Hayabusa', 'Suzuki', '1340cc');
            let bike2 = new Vehicle('Ninja', 'Kawasaki', '998cc');
            
            document.write(bike1.name);
            document.write(bike2.maker);
            document.write(bike1.getDetails());

            Output: Hayabusa
                    Kawasaki
                    The name of the bike is Hayabusa.
           
            As seen in the above example it is much simpler to define and reuse objects in ES6. Hence, we would be using ES6 in all of our examples.
