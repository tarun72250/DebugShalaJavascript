        Inheritance: Inherit and acquire the properties of super class into base class or child class.
        Creating specialized entity from existing genralized entity.
        getting few thing and add few thing is the concept of inheritance
        It is a concept in which some properties and methods of an Object are being used by another Object. Unlike most of the OOP languages where classes inherit classes, JavaScript Objects inherit Objects i.e. certain features (property and methods) of one object can be reused by other Objects.

        Real life example : Person class is reused to create class Student.
        Person class is also reused to create class Employee.
         
       Example: Let’s understand inheritance and polymorphism with an example.

       // Inheritance example
        class person 
        {
            constructor(name) 
            {
                this.name = name;
            }
            // method to return the string
            toString() 
            {
                return (`Name of person: ${this.name}`);
            }
        }

        class student extends person 
        {
            constructor(name, id) 
            {
                // super keyword for calling the above 
                // class constructor
                super(name);
                this.id = id;
            }
            toString() 
            {
                return (`${super.toString()},
                Student ID: ${this.id}`);
            }
        }
        
        let student1 = new student('tarun', 23);
        document.write(student1.toString());

        Output: In this example, we define a Person Object with certain properties and methods and then we inherit the Person Object in the Student Object  or Employee Object and use all the properties and methods of the person Object as well as define certain properties and methods for the Student Object and Employee Object.

        Output :
        Name of Person : tarun , Student ID : 23
        
        Note: The Person and Student objects both have the same method (i.e toString()), this is called Method Overriding. Method Overriding allows a method in a child class to have the same name(polymorphism) and method signature as that of a parent class. 
        
        In the above code, the super keyword is used to refer to the immediate parent class’s instance variable. 
        and invoking super methods as well.
