Explain Synchronous Programming:

1.What is synchronous programming?
How does the flow of execution work in synchronous programming?

2. What will be the output of the above code and why?
console.log("Start");
console.log("Middle");
console.log("End");

3.Identify the Sequence:

Write a function that logs numbers from 1 to 5 synchronously. Explain how the sequence of execution is maintained.
Real-World Example:

4.Give an example of a real-world scenario where synchronous programming is preferable.


Explain Asynchronous Programming:

5.What is asynchronous programming?

6.How does it differ from synchronous programming?
Predict the Output with setTimeout:


console.log("A");
setTimeout(function() {
  console.log("B");
}, 2000);
console.log("C");
What will be the output of the above code and why?

7.Callback Hell:

What is callback hell? Give an example of code that can lead to callback hell.
How can callback hell be avoided?

8.Explain Callbacks:

What is a callback function in JavaScript?
How are callback functions used in asynchronous programming?

9.Write a function multiply that multiplies two numbers and a function calculate that takes two numbers and a callback function. Use these functions to multiply two numbers and log the result.

10.What will be the output of the above code and why?

function printMessage(message, callback) {
  console.log(message);
  callback();
}

function logMessage() {
  console.log("Callback executed");
}

printMessage("Hello, world!", logMessage);
